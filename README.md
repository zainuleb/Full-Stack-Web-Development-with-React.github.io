# Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-React.github.io
Front-end and hybrid mobile development, with server-side support, for implementing a multi-platform solution. The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and React. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using React Native. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express framework, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. Learners enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Ideally learners should complete the courses in the specified sequence. It is strongly recommended that the React course be completed before proceeding with the React Native course.
